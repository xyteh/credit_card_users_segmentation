# Credit Card Users Segmentation

This project aims to break down credit card users of a bank into segments which can help the bank to understand their credit card users.

For this project, we will segment our data with K-means clustering, an algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset.

The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle and it is uploaded by UCI Machine Learning.
